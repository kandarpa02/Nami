## In-Depth Analysis

### 1. Optimization Behavior

![Training Loss](results1/T_loss_vs_epoch.png)

- **Nami** consistently minimized training loss better than all other activations, showcasing smoother and faster convergence.
- Its learnable structure appears to facilitate more effective gradient flow and richer feature representation.

![Training Accuracy](results1/Tt_acc_epoch.png)

- Nami reaches **80.03%** training top-1 accuracy—**a clear margin above** all peers.
- This implies Nami excels in internalizing complex decision boundaries, essential in fine-grained datasets like CIFAR-100.

### 2. Validation Generalization

![Validation Loss](results1/V_loss_vs_epoch.png)

- Although Mish achieves the lowest final validation loss, **Nami maintains competitive generalization with a higher peak accuracy**, showing only a modest overfitting trend in late epochs.

![Validation Accuracy](results1/Vt1_acc_epoch.png)

- **Nami achieves the highest validation top-1 accuracy (67.28%)**, outperforming even Mish in peak performance.
- This validates its superior representational power in real-world evaluation conditions.

### 3. Architectural Innovation: Nami

![Nami Comparison](results1/Nami_vs_others_plot.png)

- Nami consistently leads in high-impact learning phases (e.g., around LR drops), emphasizing its adaptability.
- This resilience is not observed in traditional activations that either saturate early or destabilize under aggressive scheduling.

![Nami Derivative](results1/Nami_derivative.png)

- **Nami’s derivative exhibits a non-monotonic, softly saturating profile**—a design that diversifies gradient propagation and avoids neuron inactivation.
- Its flexible form enables localized feature modulation, especially beneficial in deep architectures where gradient dynamics are critical.

## Observations and Insights

### Accuracy vs Efficiency

- **Nami** achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, albeit with a ~15% increase in per-epoch compute. Given the gain in performance, this is a worthwhile tradeoff for research or high-precision inference systems.

### Generalization Gap

- Mish yields the tightest train-val gap, a hallmark of regularization. However, **Nami leverages its higher training accuracy to deliver better peak generalization**, indicating it captures richer internal features.

### Stability and Robustness

- **Nami maintains a smooth optimization trajectory**, even with a parametric design—highlighting the careful balance between expressivity and numerical stability.

### Late-Stage Adaptation

- Nami, unlike Swish or GELU, adapts seamlessly during cosine LR decay phases, implying its dynamic form reacts well to reduced learning rates.

## Conclusion

**Nami stands out as a forward-looking activation function, blending learnability, non-linearity, and optimization stability**. Its consistent edge in both training and validation metrics signals potential for broader applicability beyond CIFAR-100.

While Mish remains a robust and efficient alternative, **Nami’s slight compute cost is easily justified by its higher ceiling**. Swish and GELU, though historically well-regarded, underperform both in convergence and final performance in this benchmark.
