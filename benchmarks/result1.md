## Conclusion

**Nami** emerges as the top-performing activation function, achieving the highest validation accuracy (67.28%) while demonstrating robust optimization characteristics. Its learnable parameter structure provides superior representational capacity for complex visual recognition tasks.

**Mish** presents the most balanced solution, delivering near-equivalent accuracy to Nami (66.61%) with significantly better training efficiency and stability. Its consistent performance makes it ideal for production systems with resource constraints.

**Swish** offers computational efficiency but lags in final accuracy, while **GELU** shows limitations in generalization capability for this architecture-dataset combination.

These results highlight activation function selection as a critical hyperparameter choice that significantly impacts model performance. Future work should explore Nami's scalability to larger datasets (ImageNet) and its interaction with advanced regularization techniques.
